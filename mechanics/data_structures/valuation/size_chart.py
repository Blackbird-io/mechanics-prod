#size_chart

##
#add main ``size_chart`` to GlobalVariables
    #assign relative "sizes" to companies based on revenue (keep things simple at first)
    #standard collection of keys
    #can be universal at first, across all industries; "xs", "s", "m", "l", "xl"
    #globals.size_chart = SizeChart(), w min revenue numbers?
    #and may be a sizer function

#then store multiples based on size
    #then multiples can map to these values; size_chart can be an object?
    #should be a taxonomy object, so always ok to land on nothing / standard
    #
